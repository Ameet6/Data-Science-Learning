    "## 1. What is Inferential Statistics?\n",
    "- Inferential statistics is the branch of statistics that helps us make conclusions or predictions about a population based on data collected from a sample.\n",
    "- Unlike descriptive statistics (which only summarizes data), inferential statistics allows us to generalize from a smaller dataset to a larger group.\n",
    "\n",
    "![alt text](Inferential-Statistics.jpg)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## 2. Key Ideas\n",
    "- **Population vs. Sample**\n",
    "    - Population: entire group we want to study (e.g., all students in a country).\n",
    "    - Sample: smaller part of the population (e.g., 200 students surveyed).\n",
    "    - Goal: Use sample data to make statements about the population.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Probability**\n",
    "    - Foundation of inferential statistics.\n",
    "    - Helps measure uncertainty in predictions.\n",
    "- Random Sampling\n",
    "    - Ensures the sample is representative of the population.\n",
    "\n",
    " ## 3. Main Techniques in Inferential Statistics\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Estimation**\n",
    "    - Point Estimation ‚Üí estimating a parameter (e.g., population mean) using a sample mean.\n",
    "    - Interval Estimation ‚Üí Confidence Intervals (range of values within which the population parameter lies with a certain probability).\n",
    "- **Hypothesis Testing**\n",
    "    - Formulate assumptions (null & alternative hypotheses).\n",
    "    - Use tests (t-test, chi-square, ANOVA, etc.) to check if sample evidence supports/rejects the null hypothesis.\n",
    "    - Relies on concepts like p-value and significance level (Œ±).\n",
    "- **Regression & Correlation**\n",
    "    - Analyze relationships between variables.\n",
    "    - Regression ‚Üí predict one variable based on others.\n",
    "    - Correlation ‚Üí measure strength of linear relationship."
